Tanks! - Unity Game Tutorial
Project Overview
Tanks! is a beginner-friendly Unity tutorial project that guides you through the development of a local multiplayer tank battle game. In this game, two players control tanks and attempt to destroy each other by shooting shells across a level. The tutorial covers key Unity features, including physics, game object interactions, camera control, particle systems, and UI elements.

The tutorial teaches you how to create:

Playable tanks with movement and shooting mechanics.
Destructible and interactable objects in the game world.
A user interface (UI) that displays player health, scoring, and game over conditions.
Audio feedback using Unity's built-in sound system.
Special effects like explosions using particle systems.
Features
Two-player Local Multiplayer: Players can use the same device to battle each other, with separate controls for each tank.
Tank Movement: Players can move their tanks around the battlefield using keyboard input or controller input.
Shooting and Destroying: Players can shoot shells at each other, and tanks get destroyed when their health reaches zero.
Power-Ups and Obstacles: Interact with the environment by collecting power-ups or avoiding obstacles that can affect tank movement and gameplay.
Particle Effects and Explosions: Special effects when tanks shoot and explode.
Responsive User Interface: Displays health bars, game over screens, and winner announcements.
System Requirements
Unity Version: The project works with Unity 2017 or later.
Operating System: Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, or a modern Linux distribution.
Hardware:
Graphics Card: DirectX 11 compatible or better.
Processor: Intel i5 processor or higher recommended.
RAM: At least 4 GB of RAM (8 GB or more recommended).
Free Disk Space: Around 10 GB free storage required.

How to Run the Game
Prerequisites
Unity Hub: Make sure you have Unity Hub installed. Download and install Unity Hub from the Unity website.
Unity Editor: Ensure you have the appropriate version of Unity (2017 or later) installed.
Steps to Set Up the Project
Download the Project Files:

Clone or download the project files to your computer.
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Open Unity:

Launch Unity Hub and select Open. Navigate to the downloaded Tanks! project folder and open it.
Build and Run:

Click the File menu and choose Build and Run to compile the game for your chosen platform (PC, Mac, etc.).
You can also run the game in the Unity Editor by pressing the Play button.
Controls
Player 1 (Keyboard):
Movement: W (Forward), S (Backward), A (Turn Left), D (Turn Right)
Shoot: Space
Player 2 (Keyboard):
Movement: Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)
Shoot: Enter
Gamepad Controls (if using controllers):
Movement: Left Analog Stick
Shoot: Right Trigger (RT)
Key Scripts
1. TankMovement.cs:
Handles the movement of the tanks based on player input. It applies force to the tank’s rigidbody to simulate realistic movement.

2. TankShooting.cs:
Handles the shooting mechanism, allowing tanks to fire shells at each other. Includes cooldown time between shots and interaction with physics to propel shells.

3. GameManager.cs:
Manages the overall game logic, including player health, winning conditions, and restarting the game.

4. CameraControl.cs:
Controls the camera to follow both players dynamically, keeping them in view during gameplay.

Customizing the Game
1. Adding More Players:
You can extend the game to support more players by duplicating the existing player setup and adjusting the input controls.

2. Creating New Levels:
Use Unity's terrain tools or import 3D models to create new battle arenas for the tanks.

3. Adding Power-Ups:
Add new prefabs like health packs, speed boosts, or weapon power-ups to enhance gameplay.

Known Issues
Collision Bugs: Tanks may sometimes clip into each other during fast movements.
Controller Compatibility: Not all game controllers may work without customization of the input settings.
